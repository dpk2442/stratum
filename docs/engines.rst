Game Engines
============

The game engines are a crucial part of the system. The engines run as background
processes and manage each game as it is played. Pretty much any turn based game
where each player has a complete knowledge of the game state can be implemented.
However, in order to accommodate this flexibility, much freedom is given in the
design and implementation of the game engines. This section documents each of
the games built in to the system, including information such as how many players
are supported, and the protocol the client is expected to implement.
